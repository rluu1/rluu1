Cuurently, I am in the fourth year of my Bachelors' in Computer Science. My passion for creating applications and websites sprouted from my nature to help improve the daily lives of individuals to retrieve information easily and overall better experience! One of my goals as I approach the tech industry for opportunities is to continue to learn and grow from my resources and respected colleagues. Always aiming to do better! In addition to my technical skills, I'm a strong communicator and team player as one of my roles include being President of the Vietnamese Student Association of WPI.
